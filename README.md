🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts car prices using machine learning techniques.
The dataset contains various car attributes (e.g., horsepower, engine size, fuel type) which are used to build a predictive model.

The workflow includes:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Building (Regression models, Random Forest, etc.)

Model Evaluation

⚙️ Installation & Requirements

📊 Results

Performed EDA to understand relationships between car features and price.

Built regression and ensemble models for prediction.

Achieved good accuracy in predicting car prices using Random Forest.

📌 Future Work

Deploy the model as a web app (e.g., using Flask/Streamlit).

Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

Try deep learning models for regression.
